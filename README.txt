This program solves a hexagonal version of the 8 tile puzzle. The puzzle actually has nine tiles because of the hexagonal shape. The program uses the Manhattan Distance heuristic and A* search to find the optimal solution to any possible puzzle.

The puzzle is input to the program through the command prompt. A sample input file (inputfile.txt) is included in the repository and displays the proper format.
